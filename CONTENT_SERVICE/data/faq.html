        <span>1. How Does the Test Function?</span>
        <p>
            The HIV Self Test comprises a petite cartridge housing a specialized test strip. Utilizing a simple finger
            prick method,
            it requires only a minimal blood sample. Rest assured, your results will be available in a concise 15-minute
            window.

    <div class="">
        <span>2. Can I Trust the Test's Accuracy?</span>
        <p>Our HIV Self Test boasts impressive accuracy, having consistently identified 99.6% of both HIV negative and
            positive
            samples in rigorous lab tests. However, it's worth noting that, like other HIV tests, there's a three-month
            window
            period. This indicates that recent exposures to HIV, specifically within the last three months, might not be
            detected.
            If you suspect a recent exposure, it's crucial to consult a medical professional or visit a specialized
            clinic.</p>

    <div class="">
        <span>3. What Should I Do if I Get a Positive Result?</span>
        <p>While the HIV Self Test is an exceptionally accurate initial screening tool, a positive result isn't a
            definitive
            diagnosis. Further confirmatory tests by a healthcare provider are essential. Should your self-test result
            be positive,
            please refer to our support links or the detailed care card included in the test kit for guidance. If a
            subsequent test
            confirms a positive result, discussing treatment options with a doctor is vital. With today's advanced
            treatments, HIV
            is a manageable condition, allowing individuals to lead full, healthy lives.</p>

    <div class="">
        <span>4. Is the Device Reusable?</span>
        <p>The HIV Self Test is designed for a one-time use to ensure the highest level of accuracy. Once utilized, it
            should be
            properly disposed of.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
        <span>5. What's the Correct Disposal Method?</span>
        <p>After completing the test, place all components, including the box, into the provided discreet disposal bag.
            Once
            sealed, this bag can be discarded with regular household waste.</p>
