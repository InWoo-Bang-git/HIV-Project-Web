        <h1>1. Understanding HIV</h1>
        <p>HIV, which stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus, is a virus that targets the immune system, specifically
            the CD4 cells (T cells) that help the immune system ward off infections. When left untreated, HIV reduces
            the number of T cells in the body, making it harder for the immune system to fight off infections and
            diseases. This vulnerability can lead to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome).</p>
        <p>HIV is believed to have originated in non-human primates in Central and West Africa. While the exact timeline
            is debated, it's thought that the virus jumped to humans (a process called zoonotic transmission) in the
            early 20th century. Since the first cases were reported in 1981, HIV/AIDS has become a global pandemic,
            affecting millions worldwide.</p>
        <p>It's crucial to differentiate between HIV and AIDS. HIV refers to the virus itself, and one can have HIV
            without developing AIDS. AIDS is the most advanced stage of the HIV infection and is characterized by a
            severely damaged immune system, leading to opportunistic infections or certain cancers. With the advancement
            of medical research and treatments, particularly the introduction of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), HIV has
            transformed from a fatal disease to a manageable chronic condition. Early detection and treatment can
            significantly prolong and improve the quality of life for individuals with HIV.</p>

        <h1>2. Prevention Matters</h1>
        <p>Preventing HIV transmission is crucial not only for individual health but also for the health of communities.
            Knowledge is power, and understanding how HIV is transmitted can help you make informed decisions.</p>
        <p>The use of condoms consistently and correctly is one of the most effective methods to prevent HIV and other
            sexually transmitted infections. For those at high risk, Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is a medication
            that can be taken daily to prevent HIV.</p>
        <p>Regular testing is also a cornerstone of HIV prevention. Knowing your status allows you to take steps to
            protect yourself and your partners. If you are living with HIV, starting treatment as soon as possible will
            keep you healthy and reduce the risk of transmitting the virus.</p>
        <p>Avoid sharing needles or equipment if you inject drugs. If you're considering getting a tattoo or piercing,
            ensure that the establishment follows strict hygiene practices.</p>
        <p>Educate yourself and others. The more people know about HIV, its transmission, and prevention, the more they
            can protect themselves and reduce the stigma surrounding the disease.</p>

        <h1>3. Living Well with HIV</h1>
        <p>Being diagnosed with HIV can be overwhelming, but with proper care and treatment, one can lead a normal,
            healthy life. Modern medicine has transformed HIV from a fatal disease to a manageable chronic condition.
        </p>
        <p>Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is vital. ART helps lower the viral load, maintain a healthy immune
            system, and reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to others. Regular medical check-ups, including
            monitoring the CD4 count and viral load, are essential to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and make
            any necessary adjustments.</p>
        <p>A balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol can also contribute to overall
            well-being. Mental health is equally important; consider seeking counseling or joining a support group to
            cope with any emotional challenges.</p>
        <p>Being informed about HIV and its treatment can empower you to take an active role in your healthcare. Build a
            support system, which can include healthcare professionals, family, friends, or support groups, to help
            navigate the journey with HIV.</p>
        <p>Remember, living with HIV today is vastly different than it was a few decades ago. With the right care and
            support, one can lead a full, healthy life.</p>

        <h1>4. Support and Community</h1>
        <p>Discover resources for emotional support, find local organisations, and connect with a community that
            understands and uplifts each other.</p>
