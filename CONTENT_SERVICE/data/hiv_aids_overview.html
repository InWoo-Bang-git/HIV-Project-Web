        <h2>Understanding HIV and AIDS</h2>
        <span>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV):</span>
        <p>
            HIV is a retrovirus that primarily attacks the immune system, particularly the CD4 cells (T cells).
            Over time, without treatment, the number of CD4 cells can decrease, making the body more vulnerable to infections and diseases.
            If untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS. However, with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled.
        </p>
        <span>Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS):</span>
        <p>
            AIDS is not a virus but rather the advanced stage of HIV infection.
            By the time a person receives an AIDS diagnosis, their immune system is severely compromised.
            An individual with AIDS may develop severe illnesses due to their weakened immune system, and these conditions can be potentially life-threatening.

        <h2 class='subSection' href='#sec2'>Transmission of HIV</h2>
        <p>
            HIV is primarily spread through contact with certain body fluids of an infected individual. The main modes of transmission include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sexual Transmission: Unprotected anal or vaginal intercourse with an infected person poses a significant risk. Using condoms or other biomedical prevention methods can reduce this risk.</li>
            <li>Injection Drug Use: Sharing needles, syringes, or other drug-injecting equipment can transmit HIV. It's crucial always to use sterile equipment.</li>
            <li>Mother-to-Child Transmission: HIV can be passed from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. However, with proper medical care and treatment, the risk of transmission can be significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>Other Methods: Tattoos or medical procedures using unsterilized equipment. Occupational exposure, such as needle-stick injuries among healthcare workers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="hTitle">HIV Transmission in Australia</h2>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Sexual Activities: Engaging in unprotected anal or vaginal intercourse without using condoms or other preventive measures poses a high risk.</li>
                <li>Drug Use: Sharing needles or syringes increases the chances of HIV transmission.</li>
                <li>Mother-to-Child: Transmission can occur if the mother is unaware of her HIV-positive status or if she isn't receiving effective treatment.</li>
                <li>Tattooing and Medical Procedures: Using non-sterile equipment can lead to the transmission of HIV.</li>
                <li>Occupational Hazards: Healthcare professionals and others are at risk from needle stick injuries and other forms of accidental exposure.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 class='subSection' href='#sec3'>Prevention and Awareness</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding the modes of HIV transmission and taking preventive measures are essential. Regular testing, practicing safe sex, and seeking timely medical care if one believes they might have been exposed to the virus can make a significant difference in controlling the spread of HIV.
