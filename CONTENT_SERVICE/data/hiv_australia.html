        <h1>Questions You Might Have About HIV</h1>
        <p>If you've been recently diagnosed with HIV, you likely have several questions. Here are some common ones
            along with brief answers:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Will my HIV diagnosis lead to AIDS?</strong><br>No, not necessarily. With timely and proper
                treatment, many people with HIV can live long, healthy lives without developing AIDS. It's essential to
                follow your doctor's advice and start antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as recommended.</li>
            <li><strong>How can I maintain my health and prevent other infections?</strong><br>Regular medical
                check-ups, a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding exposure to other infections can help. It's
                also essential to take any prescribed medications consistently.</li>
            <li><strong>What steps can I take to prevent transmitting HIV to others?</strong><br>Consistently and
                correctly using condoms, informing your partners about your HIV status, taking HIV medications to reduce
                viral load, and avoiding sharing needles are crucial steps.</li>
            <li><strong>Will HIV treatment change my daily life significantly?</strong><br>While starting any medication
                might have side effects, most people adjust with time. Taking your medication consistently and attending
                regular medical appointments will become part of your routine.</li>
            <li><strong>How should I inform my partner about my HIV status?</strong><br>Choose a private and comfortable
                setting. Be honest, provide them with educational resources, and consider counseling or therapy for
                support.</li>
            <li><strong>Is it necessary to inform my employer or coworkers about my HIV status?</strong><br>Legally, you
                are not required to disclose your HIV status to your employer or coworkers. However, consider what's
                best for your mental and emotional well-being.</li>
            <li><strong>Are there any support groups available for individuals with HIV?</strong><br>Yes, many
                organizations and online platforms offer support groups for people living with HIV.</li>
            <li><strong>How can I afford my HIV medications?</strong><br>Several assistance programs can help cover the
                costs of HIV medications. Your healthcare provider or local HIV/AIDS organizations can guide you.</li>
