    <h1>Information about STIs</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. What are STIs and BBVs?</h2>
        <p>Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) are infections primarily passed through sexual contact. Depending on
            the causative agent, they might be bacterial, viral, or parasitic. Some common STIs include gonorrhea,
            chlamydia, and syphilis. Blood-Borne Viruses (BBVs) like HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C are transmitted
            when uninfected individuals come in contact with infected blood.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. How are STIs and BBVs spread?</h2>
        <p>STIs spread through unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Some, like herpes and HPV, can transmit through
            skin-to-skin contact. Pregnant women can also pass STIs to their unborn child. BBVs spread through blood
            contact, often via shared needles, unscreened blood transfusions, or unprotected intercourse.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. How can I lower my risk of getting STIs and BBVs?</h2>
        <p>Reducing exposure is key. Using condoms correctly, limiting sexual partners, regular screening, and avoiding
            shared needles are effective preventive measures. Vaccinations for certain diseases, like HPV and hepatitis
            B, offer added protection. Regular health checkups and STI screenings are essential, especially if you're in
            a high-risk category.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. How would I know If I have an STI or a BBV?</h2>
        <p>Many STIs and BBVs can be asymptomatic for long durations. However, symptoms like genital sores, unusual
            discharge, pain during intercourse, or flu-like symptoms might surface. Regular medical check-ups and
            screenings are pivotal in early detection and management. If diagnosed, early intervention often leads to
            better outcomes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. What are the common symptoms of STIs?</h2>
        <p>Symptoms can vary, but common signs include sores or bumps on the genitals, oral or rectal areas, unusual
            discharge, itching, pain during intercourse, and burning during urination.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. How are STIs transmitted?</h2>
        <p>STIs are transmitted through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Some STIs can also be
            spread
            through non-sexual means such as shared needles.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. How can STIs be prevented?</h2>
        <p>Using condoms consistently, getting vaccinated, regular check-ups, and practicing mutual monogamy are
            effective
            preventive measures.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>8. Are STIs curable?</h2>
        <p>Many STIs, especially bacterial ones, are curable with the right medication. However, viral STIs like HIV and
            herpes cannot be cured but can be managed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>9. What is the difference between an STI and an STD?</h2>
        <p>STI refers to 'Sexually Transmitted Infection' and STD refers to 'Sexually Transmitted Disease'. An infection
            might not always lead to disease, making 'STI' a broader term.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>10. Can STIs lead to other health complications?</h2>
        <p>Yes, untreated STIs can lead to severe health complications, including infertility, ectopic pregnancy,
            certain
            cancers, and increased susceptibility to HIV.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>11. How often should one get tested for STIs?</h2>
        <p>Regular testing is recommended, especially if you have new or multiple sexual partners. The frequency depends
            on
            individual risk factors.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>12. What role do vaccines play in STI prevention?</h2>
        <p>Vaccines are available for certain STIs like HPV and hepatitis B, offering protection against these
            infections.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>13. Are oral and anal sex safe from STIs?</h2>
        <p>Oral and anal sex can also transmit STIs. Using barriers like dental dams or condoms during such activities
            can
            reduce the risk.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>14. Can STIs be transmitted through non-sexual activities?</h2>
        <p>Yes, some STIs like HIV and hepatitis B and C can be transmitted through shared needles, from mother to child
            during childbirth, or through blood transfusions.</p>
