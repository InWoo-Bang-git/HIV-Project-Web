    <h1>Understanding HIV</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. About HIV/AIDS</h2>
        <p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) targets the immune system, specifically the CD4 cells (T-cells). Over
            time, the reduction in the number of these cells leaves the body susceptible to infections and diseases.
            AIDS, or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, is the final stage of HIV infection. Here, the immune system is
            so weakened that the body can't fend off opportunistic infections or certain cancers.</p>
        <p>HIV is transmitted through contact with infected blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. This can
            happen through unprotected sex, sharing of needles, from mother to child during childbirth, and
            breastfeeding. Unlike viruses like the common cold or flu, the human body can't rid itself of HIV, meaning
            once you have it, you have it for life. However, with proper treatment, HIV can be managed and progression
            to AIDS can be halted.</p>

        <h2>2. HIV Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Upon contracting HIV, an individual may experience a variety of symptoms, which evolve over time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Acute HIV Infection: Within 2-4 weeks post-infection, many people develop flu-like symptoms, termed
                acute retroviral syndrome. Symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and rash.
                This is the body's natural response to the infection.</li>
            <li>Chronic HIV Infection: After the initial symptoms subside, an individual can feel asymptomatic for
                years. However, the virus continues to thrive, multiplying and gradually destroying immune cells.</li>
            <li>Symptomatic HIV Infection: As immunity weakens, a range of symptoms like prolonged fever, fatigue,
                diarrhea, weight loss, oral yeast infection, and shingles might manifest.</li>
            <li>AIDS: At this severe stage, symptoms include chronic fever, prolonged swollen lymph nodes, certain
                cancers, and susceptibility to severe opportunistic infections.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. How to get tested for HIV?</h2>
        <p>It's crucial to get tested if you believe you've been exposed to HIV. There are various testing methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Antibody Test: This test detects HIV antibodies in the blood or saliva. However, there's a 'window
                period' post-infection during which the test might not detect the virus.</li>
            <li>Antigen/Antibody Test: A blood test, it identifies both HIV antibodies and the p24 protein, increasing
                the chances of early detection.</li>
            <li>Nucleic Acid Test (NAT): By looking for the virus in the blood, it can detect HIV within 10 days
                post-infection.</li>
            <li>Regular testing is paramount for those at elevated risk, including individuals with multiple sexual
                partners, those who share needles, or have unprotected sex with someone whose HIV status is unknown.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. HIV treatment &amp; side effects</h2>
        <p>HIV treatment primarily revolves around Antiretroviral therapy (ART). While it doesn't eradicate the virus,
            ART suppresses it, allowing the immune system to rejuvenate. The medication regimen involves daily intake.
        </p>
        <p>However, ART can exhibit side effects. Some common ones include nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue. In the long
            term, issues like heart disease, bone loss, abnormal fat distribution, and elevated cholesterol or glucose
            can arise. Regular monitoring by healthcare professionals ensures side effects are managed effectively.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. HIV - Stigma &amp; Discrimination</h2>
        <p>HIV-related stigma and discrimination remain global concerns. Infected individuals often face rejection,
            marginalization, and violence. This can deter them from seeking timely medical care or revealing their
            status. Many societies harbor misconceptions about HIV/AIDS, leading to unfounded fears and resultant
            discrimination. Breaking this cycle requires concerted educational and advocacy efforts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. What is the difference between HIV-1 and HIV-2?</h2>
        <p>HIV-1 and HIV-2 are two distinct viruses. While both can cause AIDS, HIV-1 is more common worldwide and is
            the
            type often referred to simply as 'HIV'. HIV-2 is less transmissible and primarily found in West Africa.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. How is HIV diagnosed?</h2>
        <p>HIV is diagnosed through blood tests which detect the presence of HIV antibodies or the virus itself. The
            most
            common test is the antibody screening test (also called immunoassay), which can be done as a rapid test or a
            lab
            test.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>8. Can HIV be cured?</h2>
        <p>As of now, there is no cure for HIV. However, with proper medical care, it can be controlled.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>9. What are the stages of HIV?</h2>
        <p>HIV progresses in three stages: Acute HIV infection, chronic HIV infection, and acquired immunodeficiency
            syndrome (AIDS). With proper treatment, progression can be halted.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>10. How effective is Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)?</h2>
        <p>ART is highly effective in preventing HIV replication. It reduces the viral load, making it undetectable in
            the blood. An undetectable viral load means the disease is untransmittable.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>11. Can pregnant women with HIV have healthy babies?</h2>
        <p>Yes, with proper medical care and treatment, pregnant women with HIV can reduce the risk of transmission to
            their babies to less than 1%.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>12. What is the significance of 'Undetectable Equals Untransmittable' (U=U)?</h2>
        <p>U=U signifies that people with HIV who achieve and maintain an undetectable viral load cannot sexually
            transmit the virus to HIV-negative partners.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>13. How does HIV affect the immune system?</h2>
        <p>HIV attacks and destroys CD4 cells, which are crucial for immune responses. A depleted CD4 count makes an
            individual susceptible to opportunistic infections.</p>
