  <div>
    <p>
      HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the immune
      system, specifically CD4 cells (T cells), which help the immune system
      fight off infections. HIV can lead to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency
      Syndrome) if left untreated. Symptoms of HIV can vary widely, and some
      individuals may not experience any noticeable symptoms for years after
      contracting the virus.

  <h1 class="subSection" href="#sec2">Stages of HIV</h1>
  <div>
    <h2>1. Acute HIV Infection (Early Stage):</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fever</li>
      <li>Fatigue</li>
      <li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
      <li>Sore throat</li>
      <li>Muscle and joint aches</li>
      <li>Headache</li>
      <li>Diarrhea Nausea and vomiting</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      <p>
        These symptoms usually occur within 2 to 4 weeks after exposure to the
        virus and may resemble flu-like symptoms. Some people may not notice
        these symptoms or mistake them for another illness.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>2. Clinical Latency Stage (Chronic HIV Infection):</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        During this stage, which can last for years, most people with HIV have
        no specific symptoms.
      </li>
      <li>Fatigue</li>
      <li>
        The virus continues to replicate at very low levels, and the immune
        system may gradually weaken.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>AIDS (Advanced Stage):</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        If HIV is left untreated, it can progress to AIDS. AIDS is diagnosed
        when the immune system is severely damaged, and the person becomes
        susceptible to opportunistic infections and certain cancers. Symptoms at
        this stage can include:
      </p>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Rapid weight loss
      </li>
      <li>Recurring fever or profuse night sweats</li>
      <li>Prolonged swelling of lymph nodes</li>
      <li>Chronic diarrhea</li>
      <li>Skin problems, including rashes or sores</li>
      <li>Recurrent respiratory infections</li>
      <li>Memory loss, depression, and other neurological disorders</li>
    </ul>
