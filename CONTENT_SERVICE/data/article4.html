    <div>
      <p>
        HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) treatment involves the use of
        antiretroviral therapy (ART) to manage the virus and maintain a healthy
        immune system. The goals of HIV treatment are to:
      </p>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Suppress the virus to undetectable levels in the blood.</li>
      <li>Restore and preserve the immune system's function.</li>
      <li>Prevent HIV-related complications and progression to AIDS.</li>
      <li>Reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      <p>
        ART typically consists of a combination of different antiretroviral
        drugs, which work by interfering with various stages of the HIV life
        cycle. There are several classes of these drugs, including nucleoside
        reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse
        transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), integrase
        strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), and entry inhibitors.
