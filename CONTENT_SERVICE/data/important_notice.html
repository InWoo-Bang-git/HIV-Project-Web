    <h1>Important Notice from HIV TestKit Encourage</h1>
    <p>Being HIV positive is manageable, and with proper care, individuals can lead long, active, and healthy lives.
        Remember, if you've used a self-testing kit, it serves as a preliminary screening. A positive result does not
        confirm an HIV diagnosis. Should you receive a positive outcome, it's crucial to seek confirmatory testing at a
        healthcare facility. An early diagnosis allows for timely treatment initiation.</p>
